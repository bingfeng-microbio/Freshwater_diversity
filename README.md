A fifth of global freshwater ecosystems under climate change risk
The scripts used in the study
Microbes represent the largest portion of biodiversity in freshwater environments, and are essential for the provisioning of clean water and pathogen control for humankind3. Unfortunately, the fate of this unique biodiversity remains largely unknown under climate change. Here, we integrate 2,022 metagenomic freshwater samples with machine learning models to systematically evaluate to what extend freshwater microbiomes will be affected by future climate change. This knowledge is key to determine the global conservation priorities for freshwater microbiota and ecosystem services. Strikingly, our analyses revealed that over 20% of global areas will experience significant changes in microbial diversity under climate change scenarios, accompanied by altered nutrient acquisition strategies, increased risks of antibiotic resistance and pathogenic potential under non-sustainable climate scenarios. Conserving this biodiversity will be challenging as our study reveals the major hotspots of the diversity and functional traits of archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses peak in distinct regions of the planet. Our work provides valuable tools for integrating conservation strategies with targeted climate intervention policies for managing the microbial diversity hotspots in freshwater ecosystems.
